<h3>Recipes - World's Best Scrambled Eggs</h3>
<p>I adapted this recpie from a book called Sydney Food by Bill Granger. Ever since tasting these eggs on my 1<sup>st</sup> visit to Bill's restaurant in Kings Cross,<br>Sydeny. I have been after the recipe I have since transformed it into what i really believe are the best scrambled eggs I have ever tasted</p>
<p>This recipe is what i call a "very special breakfast", just look at the ingredients to see why it has to be believed</p>
